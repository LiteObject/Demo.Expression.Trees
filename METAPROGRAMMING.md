# What is Metaprogramming?

Metaprogramming is a programming technique where programs have the ability to treat other programs as their data. This means a program can generate, modify, or analyze code dynamically at runtime. Metaprogramming is useful for scenarios like code generation, dynamic method invocation, or aspect-oriented programming.

## Example: Using Reflection in C#
In C#, one way to achieve metaprogramming is through reflection, which allows inspecting and modifying metadata of types at runtime.

### Example: Invoking a Method Dynamically Using Reflection

```csharp
using System;
using System.Reflection;

class Program
{
    public void SayHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from Metaprogramming!");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Get the type of the Program class
        Type type = typeof(Program);

        // Create an instance of the Program class
        object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);

        // Get the method info for SayHello
        MethodInfo method = type.GetMethod("SayHello");

        // Invoke the SayHello method dynamically
        method.Invoke(instance, null);
    }
}

```

### Explanation:
1. Reflection is used to inspect the `Program` class.
2. An instance of `Program` is created dynamically using `Activator.CreateInstance()`.
3. The method `SayHello` is fetched using `GetMethod()`.
4. It is then invoked dynamically using `Invoke()`.

This is a simple example, but metaprogramming in C# can go much deeper with features like expression trees, code generation, and dynamic types (e.g., using `System.Reflection.Emit` or `Roslyn` for runtime compilation).
